In my humble opinion, it would take quite some time to learn and get used to it.  I do believe it seems more logical, and it is easier to read.

Given that you need to work while learning, an action I would be implementing is to create easy access references or Cheat Sheets for specific areas.  That way I can check back, refresh topics, and move faster in my execution.  Aa I learn more things, I could continue updating them.  \n",

I have not had a lot of visibility of all the options Python provides, but as I started learning, the visualizations and creations you can do in the tool are quite amazing.  Histograms, distributions, and other visualizations look sharper and easier than the ones in R.  As a result, I would try to devote a single Cheat Sheet to this area and identify all the potential opportunities.  "
